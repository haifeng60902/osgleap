#summary ToDo-Page for osgLeap
= List of open issues =
  * Build support for GCC
  * Build support for MSVC++ 2010
  * Build support for MSVC++ 2012
  * Rework CMake script:
    * Check respect of Debug and Release versions and possible mixing
    * When I have manually defined LEAP_LIBRARY in the cmake-gui, defining both debug and optimized libraries manually (using the debug and optimized tags), the example fails to build, because both debug and release libraries are added to the link together, including even nonsense like debug.lib and release.lib (CMake seems to be interpreting the tags as additional libraries ...)
